# FS22_DashboardLive

Dashboard Live (short: DBL) allows you to display all kinds of information in your board computers and/or dashboards in all kinds of tractors, no matter what brand. 

A zoom function is included for better viewing of displays: 
- Left shift key + space bar: Short zoom
- Both shift keys + space bar: Permanent zoom on/off 

If supported in the vehicle, the right Alt key and left/right arrow can be used to scroll through displays.

In MultiPlayer game, DBL synchronises engine temperature, fuel and air consumption from the server to the clients.
