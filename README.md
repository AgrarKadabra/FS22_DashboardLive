# FS22_DashboardLive

**Look out: This is a developer version which can and shurely will contain errors, blow up your logfile with debug entries and maybe break your savegame. So use this version at your own risk**

Dashboard Live (short: DBL) has to be built into your vehicles and then allows you to display all kinds of information in your board computers and/or dashboards in all kinds of tractors, no matter what brand. 

A zoom function is included for better viewing of displays: 
- Left shift key + space bar: Short zoom
- Both shift keys + space bar: Permanent zoom on/off 

If supported in the vehicle, the right Alt key and left/right arrow can be used to scroll through displays.

In MultiPlayer game, DBL synchronises engine temperature, fuel and air consumption from the server to the clients.

**Please report bugs and problems as issues. For ideas and wishes please open a discussion.**

Here you will find the most actual documentation of DBL: https://github.com/jason0611/FS22_DashboardLive/blob/master/doc/DashboardLive.pdf
